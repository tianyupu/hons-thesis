  abstract = { The analysis of cancer survival is used to determine the efficiency
	of treatment programmes and protocols; it is also used to determine
	the type of treatment. At the individual level a prediction of cancer
	survival can help patients make informed decisions with regards to
	their quality of life and future finances. Currently available prediction
	methods apply to groups of people, and may not be adequate to predict
	treatment outcome for individual patients. This paper presents a
	conceptual model of a cancer knowledge base incorporating a computer-based
	predictor for survival. It proposes the use of an artificial neural
	network (ANN) as an alternative tool for investigating cancer survival.
	The focus of this research will be on nasopharyngeal carcinoma survival
	data collected in Malaysia. },

  abstract = {Incremental variants of the nearest neighbor algorithm are a potentially
	suitable choice for incremental learning tasks. They have fast learning
	rates, low updating costs, and have recorded comparatively high classification
	accuracies in several applications. Although the nearest neighbor
	algorithm suffers from high storage requirements, modifications exist
	that significantly reduce this problem. Unfortunately, its applicability
	is limited by several other serious problems. First, storage reduction
	variants of this algorithm are highly sensitive to noise. Second,
	these algorithms are sensitive to irrelevant attributes. Finally,
	the nearest neighbor algorithm assumes that all instances are described
	by the same set of attributes. This inflexibility causes problems
	when subsequently processed instances introduce novel attributes
	that are relevant to the learning task. In this paper, we present
	a comprehensive sequence of three incremental, edited nearest neighbor
	algorithms that tolerate attribute noise, determine relative attribute
	relevances, and accept instances described by novel attributes. We
	outline evidence indicating that these instance-based algorithms
	are robust incremental learners. },

  volume = {77},
  pages = {81 - 97},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Background
	
	The widespread availability of new computational methods and tools
	for data analysis and predictive modeling requires medical informatics
	researchers and practitioners to systematically select the most appropriate
	strategy to cope with clinical prediction problems. In particular,
	the collection of methods known as ‘data mining’ offers methodological
	and technical solutions to deal with the analysis of medical data
	and construction of prediction models. A large variety of these methods
	requires general and simple guidelines that may help practitioners
	in the appropriate selection of data mining tools, construction and
	validation of predictive models, along with the dissemination of
	predictive models within clinical environments.
	
	
	Purpose
	
	The goal of this review is to discuss the extent and role of the research
	area of predictive data mining and to propose a framework to cope
	with the problems of constructing, assessing and exploiting data
	mining models in clinical medicine.
	
	
	Methods
	
	We review the recent relevant work published in the area of predictive
	data mining in clinical medicine, highlighting critical issues and
	summarizing the approaches in a set of learned lessons.
	
	
	Results
	
	The paper provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art
	of predictive data mining in clinical medicine and gives guidelines
	to carry out data mining studies in this field.
	
	
	Conclusions
	
	Predictive data mining is becoming an essential instrument for researchers
	and clinical practitioners in medicine. Understanding the main issues
	underlying these methods and the application of agreed and standardized
	procedures is mandatory for their deployment and the dissemination
	of results. Thanks to the integration of molecular and clinical data
	taking place within genomic medicine, the area has recently not only
	gained a fresh impulse but also a new set of complex problems it
	needs to address},

	increases length of stay among patients with medical conditions,
	decreases length of stay among those with surgical conditions, and
	decreases mortality. One interesting finding is that the medical

	regression to improve the parameter estimates and to diminish the
	error made by further predictions. Different ways to choose the unknown
	ridge parameter are discussed. The main attention focuses on ridge
	parameters obtained by cross-validation. Three different ways to
	define the prediction error are considered: classification error,
	squared error and minus log-likelihood. The use of ridge regression
	is illustrated by developing a prognostic index for the two-year
	survival probability of patients with ovarian cancer as a function
	of their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) histogram. In this example,
	the number of covariates is large compared with the number of observations
	and modelling without restrictions on the parameters leads to overfitting.
	Defining a restriction on the parameters, such that neighbouring
	intervals in the DNA histogram differ only slightly in their influence
	on the survival, yields ridge-type parameter estimates with reasonable
	values which can be clinically interpreted. Furthermore the model
	can predict new observations more accurately.},

	data. Researchers in other fields may not be aware of the particular
	constraints and difficulties of the privacy-sensitive, heterogeneous,
	but voluminous data of medicine. Ethical and legal aspects of medical
	data mining are discussed, including data ownership, fear of lawsuits,
	expected benefits, and special administrative issues. The mathematical
	understanding of estimation and hypothesis formation in medical data
	may be fundamentally different than those from other data collection
	activities. Medicine is primarily directed at patient-care activity,
	and only secondarily as a research resource; almost the only justification
	for collecting medical data is to benefit the individual patient.
	Finally, medical data have a special status based upon their applicability
	to all people; their urgency (including life-or-death); and a moral
	obligation to be used for beneficial purposes.},

  abstract = {Background: Using hospital length of stay (LOS) to measure trauma
	care efficiency is complicated by short LOS resulting from early
	mortality or transfer to long-term care (LTC).
	
	
	Methods: Records from the 1999 to 2003 National Trauma Data Bank were
	used to create a multistate model divided into four time periods,
	each with constant rates of death, discharge home, and LTC transfer.
	Estimated hospital mortality and LOS for patient subgroups were calculated
	from this model, and time-varying covariate effects were estimated.
	
	
	Results: A total of 369,829 cases with adequate data were available.
	Early mortality was increased most by hypotension or coma, and also
	by anatomic injury severity or penetrating mechanism, but these effects
	diminished with time; age remained a strong predictor of mortality
	at any time but sex was insignificant. Rates of discharge home decreased
	with time, whereas rates of LTC transfer peaked at 6 to 11 days.
	Increased age strongly predicted transfer to LTC, whereas penetrating
	or burn mechanisms made it less likely. Predicted and observed outcomes
	were similar for multiple subgroups, and about 17% of individual
	variation in LOS was explained by the model.
	
	
	Conclusions: Multistate models of patient status can accurately predict
	mortality and resource use after injury, and describe time-varying
	effects of other factors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES:
	
	To conduct a systematic review of how short-stay observation units
	(SOUs) affect the efficiency of healthcare delivery and the quality
	of services provided.
	
	DATA SOURCES:
	
	MEDLINE, CINAHL, Best Evidence and The Cochrane Library were searched
	for the period 1 January 1960 to 31 July 2000.
	
	STUDY SELECTION:
	
	Studies were eligible if published in English and rated at National
	Health and Medical Research Council evidence levels I, II-1, II-2,
	or II-3; 12 comparative studies published between 1985 and 1998 met
	these criteria.
	
	DATA EXTRACTION:
	
	Data pertaining to clinical outcomes, length of stay, re-presentation
	rates, emergency department efficiency and costs of care were extracted
	and evaluated independently.
	
	DATA SYNTHESIS:
	
	As there was considerable heterogeneity in the patient populations
	and outcomes, results were summarised rather than subjected to meta-analysis.
	
	CONCLUSION:
	
	SOUs have the potential to increase patient satisfaction, reduce length
	of stay, improve the efficiency of emergency departments and improve
	cost effectiveness. However, SOUs have commonly been implemented
	alongside new clinical protocols, and it is not possible to distinguish
	the relative benefits of each. As demand increases, providing effective
	and cost-efficient care will become increasingly important. SOUs
	may help organisations that are attempting to streamline patient
	care while maintaining their quality of service delivery.},

	a prediction rule for short stay admissions (SSAs) in trauma patients
	admitted to a major trauma centre.Methods A retrospective study of
	all trauma activation patients requiring inpatient admission at a
	single inner city major trauma centre in Australia between 2007 and
	2011 was conducted. Logistic regression was used to derive a multivariable
	model for the outcome of SSA (length of stay ≤2 days excluding deaths
	or intensive care unit admission). Model discrimination was tested
	using area under receiver operator characteristic curve analyses
	and calibration was tested using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic.
	Validation was performed by splitting the dataset into derivation
	and validation datasets and further tested using bootstrap cross
	validation.Results A total of 2593 patients were studied and 30%
	were classified as SSAs. Important independent predictors of SSA
	were injury severity score ≤8 (OR 7.8; 95% CI 5.0 to 11.9), Glasgow
	coma score 14–15 (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.8 to 5.4), no need for operative
	intervention (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) and age < 65 years. (OR
	1.7; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.6). The overall model had an area under receiver
	operator characteristic curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.87) for the
	derivation dataset. After bootstrap cross validation the area under
	the curve of the final model was 0.83 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.84).Conclusions
	We report a prediction rule that could be used to establish admission
	criteria for a trauma short stay unit. Further studies are required
	to prospectively validate the prediction rule.},

	Abstract
	
	Data mining is a powerful method to extract knowledge from data. Raw
	data faces various challenges that make traditional method improper
	for knowledge extraction. Data mining is supposed to be able to handle
	various data types in all formats. Relevance of this paper is emphasized
	by the fact that data mining is an object of research in different
	areas. In this paper, we review previous works in the context of
	knowledge extraction from medical data. The main idea in this paper
	is to describe key papers and provide some guidelines to help medical
	practitioners. Medical data mining is a multidisciplinary field with
	contribution of medicine and data mining. Due to this fact, previous
	works should be classified to cover all users’ requirements from
	various fields. Because of this, we have studied papers with the
	aim of extracting knowledge from structural medical data published
	between 1999 and 2013. We clarify medical data mining and its main
	goals. Therefore, each paper is studied based on the six medical
	tasks: screening, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, monitoring and
	management. In each task, five data mining approaches are considered:
	classification, regression, clustering, association and hybrid. At
	the end of each task, a brief summarization and discussion are stated.
	A standard framework according to CRISP-DM is additionally adapted
	to manage all activities. As a discussion, current issue and future
	trend are mentioned. The amount of the works published in this scope
	is substantial and it is impossible to discuss all of them on a single
	work. We hope this paper will make it possible to explore previous
	works and identify interesting areas for future research.},

  abstract = {Methodological challenges arise when one uses various Veterans Health
	Administration (VHA) data sources, each created for distinct purposes,
	to characterize length of stay (LOS). To illustrate this issue, we
	examined how algorithm choice affects conclusions about mental health
	condition (MHC)-related differences in LOS for VHA patients with
	diabetes nationally (n = 784,321). We assembled a record-level database
	of all fiscal year (FY) 2003 inpatient care. In 10 steps, we sequentially
	added instances of inpatient care from various VHA sources. We processed
	databases in three stages, truncating stays at the beginning and
	end of FY03 and consolidating overlapping stays. For patients with
	MHCs versus those without MHCs, mean LOS was 17.7 versus 13.6 days,
	respectively (p < 0.001), for the crudest algorithm and 37.2 versus
	21.7 days, respectively (p < 0.001), for the most refined algorithm.
	Researchers can improve the quality of data applied to VHA systems
	redesign by applying methodological considerations raised by this
	study to inform LOS algorithm choice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	framework. The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract
	extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general
	decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update
	LittlestoneâWarmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding
	bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to
	a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how
	the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems,
	including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games,
	and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we
	apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new
	boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any
	prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm.
	We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the
	problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary,
	is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line.

	predictors of mortality and morbidity and to develop prediction models
	based on these variables.Methods:Â  Tools for predicting mortality,
	hospital length of stay and a patient's destination post-hospital
	discharge were developed using logistic regression in one dataset
	(design) and evaluated for prediction performance in a separate dataset
	(validation). The performance of the mortality model was compared
	to the trauma and injury severity score (TRISS) and a severity characterization
	of trauma (ASCOT).Results:Â  The profile of variables contributing
	to the final prediction models developed from the design dataset
	varied across the different outcomes of interest although age, injury
	severity score, development of complications and triage category
	were common predictors of all three outcomes. The performance of
	the new mortality prediction model was superior to both TRISS and
	ASCOT in the validation dataset. Overall, the new models did not

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long stays in the intensive care unit are associated with
	high costs and burdens on patients and patients' families and in
	turn affect society at large. Although factors that affect length
	of stay and outcomes of care in the intensive care unit have been
	studied extensively, the conclusions reached have not been reviewed
	to determine whether they reveal an organizational pattern that might
	be of practical use in reducing length of stay in the unit. OBJECTIVE:
	To identify and categorize the factors associated with prolonged
	stays in the intensive care unit and to describe briefly the nonmedical
	interventions to date designed to reduce length of stay. METHODS:
	Articles published between January 1990 and March 2005 in English-language
	journals indexed by MEDLINE were searched for studies on outcomes
	and costs of care in the intensive care unit and on care at the end
	of life. RESULTS: The emerging consensus is that length of stay in
	the intensive care unit is exacerbated by several increasingly discernible
	medical, social, psychological, and institutional factors. At the
	same time, several nonmedical, experimental interventions have been
	designed to reduce length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions involving
	palliative care, ethics consultations, and other methods to increase
	communication between healthcare personnel, patients, and patients'
	families may be helpful in decreasing length of stay in the intensive
	care unit. Further studies are needed to provide a strategy for targeting
	specific risk factors indicated by the literature review.},

	Data Sources: The MEDLINE database, bibliographies of selected articles,
	and current texts on the subject.
	
	
	Study Selection: The studies that were selected for review used artificial
	intelligence tools for a variety of intensive care applications,
	including direct patient care and retrospective database analysis.
	
	
	Data Extraction: All literature relevant to the topic was reviewed.
	
	
	Data Synthesis: Although some of the earliest artificial intelligence
	(AI) applications were medically oriented, AI has not been widely
	accepted in medicine. Despite this, patient demographic, clinical,
	and billing data are increasingly available in an electronic format
	and therefore susceptible to analysis by intelligent software. Individual
	AI tools are specifically suited to different tasks, such as waveform
	analysis or device control.
	
	
	Conclusions: The intensive care environment is particularly suited
	to the implementation of AI tools because of the wealth of available
	data and the inherent opportunities for increased efficiency in inpatient
	care. A variety of new AI tools have become available in recent years
	that can function as intelligent assistants to clinicians, constantly
	monitoring electronic data streams for important trends, or adjusting
	the settings of bedside devices. The integration of these tools into
	the intensive care unit can be expected to reduce costs and improve
	patient outcomes.},

	A number of classification algorithms are considered and evaluated
	for their relative performances and practical usefulness on different
	types of health care datasets. The algorithms are evaluated using
	four criteria: accuracy, computational time, comprehensibility of
	the results and ease of use of the algorithm to relatively statistically
	naive medical users. The research has shown that there is not necessarily
	a single best classification tool, but instead the best performing

	of including a 7-day cutoff criterion along with the Maximum CSI
	score similar to a criterion used in an alternative severity of illness
	measure. The DRG/Maximum CSI score's predictive power increased to
	63% when the 7-day cutoff was added to the CSI definition. The Admission
	CSI score was used to predict in-hospital mortality and correlated

	learning systems were not widely accepted in medical practice. In
	this paper two different approaches to machine learning in medical
	applications are compared: the system for inductive learning of decision
	trees Assistant, and the naive Bayesian classifier. Both methodologies
	were tested in four medical diagnostic problems: localization of
	primary tumor, prognostics of recurrence of breast cancer, diagnosis
	of thyroid diseases, and rheumatology. The accuracy of automatically
	acquired diagnostic knowledge from stored data records is compared,
	and the interpretation of the knowledge and the explanation ability
	of the classification process of each system is discussed. Surprisingly,
	the naive Bayesian classifier is superior to Assistant in classification
	accuracy and explanation ability, while the interpretation of the
	acquired knowledge seems to be equally valuable. In addition, two
	extensions to naive Bayesian classifier are briefly described: dealing
	with continuous attributes, and discovering the dependencies among
	attributes.},

	or simple diagnostic tests.
	
	
	Objective. —To review the quality of recently published clinical prediction
	rules and to suggest methodological standards for their development
	and evaluation.
	
	
	Data Sources. —Four general medical journals were manually searched
	for clinical prediction rules published from 1991 through 1994.
	
	
	Study Selection. —Four hundred sixty potentially eligible reports
	were identified, of which 30 were clinical prediction rules eligible
	for study. Most methodological standards could only be evaluated
	in 29 studies.
	
	
	Data Abstraction. —Two investigators independently evaluated the quality
	of each report using a standard data sheet. Disagreements were resolved
	by consensus.
	
	
	Data Synthesis. —The mathematical technique was used to develop the
	rule, and the results of the rule were described in 100% (29/29)
	of the reports. All the rules but 1 (97% [28/29]) were felt to be
	clinically sensible. The outcomes and predictive variables were clearly
	defined in 83% (24/29) and 59% (17/29) of the reports, respectively.
	Blind assessment of outcomes and predictive variables occurred in
	41% (12/29) and 79% (23/29) of the reports, respectively, and the
	rules were prospectively validated in 79% (11/14). Reproducibility
	of predictive variables was assessed in only 3% (1/29) of the reports,
	and the effect of the rule on clinical use was prospectively measured
	in only 3% (1/30). Forty-one percent (12/29) of the rules were felt
	to be easy to use.
	
	
	Conclusions. —Although clinical prediction rules comply with some
	methodological criteria, for other criteria, better compliance is
	needed.},

	inpatient services for patients with short anticipated hospital stays.
	Yet little is known about which patient types predict SSU success.OBJECTIVE:To
	describe patients admitted to our hospitalist-run SSU and explore
	predictors of length-of-stay (LOS) and eventual admission to traditional
	inpatient services.DESIGN:Prospective observational cohort study.SETTING:Large
	public teaching hospital.PATIENTS:Consecutive admissions (n = 755)
	to the SSU over 4 months.INTERVENTION:Hospitalist attending physicians
	prospectively collected data from patients' histories, physical exams,
	and medical records upon admission and discharge.MEASUREMENTS:Risk
	assessments were made for patients with our most common provisional
	diagnoses: possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and heart failure.
	Patient stays were considered successful when LOS was less than 72
	hours and eventual admission to traditional inpatient services was
	not required.RESULTS:Of 738 eligible patients, 79% (n = 582) had
	successful SSU stays. In a multivariable model, the provisional diagnosis
	of heart failure predicted stays longer than 72 hours (P = 0.007)
	but risk assessments were unimportant. Patients who received specialty
	consultations were most likely to need eventual admission (odds ratio
	[OR], 13.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.9-24.9), and the likelihood
	of long stays was inversely proportional to the accessibility of
	diagnostic tests.CONCLUSIONS:In our hospitalist-run SSU, the inaccessibility
	of diagnostic tests and the need for specialty consultations were
	the most important predictors of unsuccessful stays. Designs for
	other SSUs that care for mostly low-risk patients should focus on
	matching patients' diagnostic and consultative needs with readily
	accessible services. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2009;4:276–284.

  abstract = {Objectives:â While hospital length of stay (LOS) has been used as
	a surrogate injury outcome when more detailed outcomes are unavailable,
	it has not been validated. This project sought to validate LOS as
	a proxy measure of injury severity and resource use in heterogeneous
	injury populations.Methods:â This observational study used four
	retrospective cohorts: patients presenting to 339 California emergency
	departments (EDs) with a primary International Classification of
	Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), injury diagnosis (years 2005â2006);
	California hospital injury admissions (a subset of the ED population);
	trauma patients presenting to 48 Oregon EDs (years 1998â2003);
	and injured Medicare patients admitted to 171 Oregon and Washington
	hospitals (years 2001â2002). In-hospital deaths were excluded,
	as they represent adverse outcomes regardless of LOS. Duration of
	hospital stay was defined as the number of days from ED admission
	to hospital discharge. The primary composite outcome (dichotomous)
	was serious injury (Injury Severity Score [ISS] â¥ 16 or ICD-9 ISS
	â¤ 0.90) or resource use (major surgery, blood transfusion, or prolonged
	ventilation). The discriminatory accuracy of LOS for identifying
	the composite outcome was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic
	(ROC) analysis. Analyses were also stratified by age (0â14, 15â64,
	and â¥65Â years), hospital type, and hospital annual admission volume.Results:â
	The four cohorts included 3,989,409 California ED injury visits (including
	admissions), 236,639 California injury admissions, 23,817 Oregon
	trauma patients, and 30,804 Medicare injury admissions. Composite
	outcome rates for the four cohorts were 2.1%, 29%, 27%, and 22%,
	respectively. Areas under the ROC curves for overall LOS were 0.88
	(California ED), 0.74 (California admissions), 0.82 (Oregon trauma
	patients), and 0.68 (Medicare patients). In general, the discriminatory
	value of LOS was highest among children, tertiary trauma centers,
	and higher volume hospitals, although this finding differed by the
	injury population and outcome assessed.Conclusions:â Hospital LOS
	may be a reasonable proxy for serious injury and resource use among
	injury survivors when more detailed outcomes are unavailable, although
	the discriminatory value differs by age and the injury population
	being studied.ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2010; 17:142â150 Â© 2010

  abstract = {This research examines how the patients' characteristics and clinical
	indicators affect length of stay for the top five Diagnosis-Related-Groups
	(DRGs) for Medicare patients at a teaching hospital in the United
	States. The top DRGs were selected on the basis of volume per year.
	Teaching hospitals in the United States devote a significant amount
	of their resources to research and teaching, while providing treatment
	for patients. The ability to predict length of stay can substantially
	improve a teaching hospital's capacity utilization, while ensuring
	that resources are available to meet the health care needs of the
	Medicare population. Multiple regression models are developed to
	predict the length of stay using the patients' characteristics and
	clinical indicators as independent variables. The results indicate
	that approximately 60 percent (R(2)) of the variance in the length
	of stay is explained by the patients' characteristics and clinical
	indicators for these DRGs. The Mortality and Severity indices are
	found to be the strongest predictors for length of stay in all DRGs.
	Other patients' characteristics and clinical indicators such as age,
	gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, admission type and admission
	source are also significant predictors for some DRGs. In addition,
	most of these variables affect the length of stay in the same manner
	as shown in previous studies, even though the previous studies do
	not have the DRG specificity of this study.},

	for hospital resource consumption and to monitor the performance
	of the hospital. Predicting the patient's length of stay in a hospital
	is an important aspect for effective planning at various levels.
	It helps in efficient utilization of resources and facilities. So,
	there exist a strong demand to make accurate and robust models to
	predict length of stay. This paper analyzes various methods for length
	of stay prediction, its advantages and disadvantages and proposes
	a novel approach for predicting whether the length of stay of the
	patient is greater than one week. The approach uses DBSCAN clustering
	to create the training set for classification. The prediction models
	are compared using accuracy, precision and recall and found that

  abstract = {Length of stay (LOS) predictions in acute pancreatitis could be used
	to stratify patients with severe acute pancreatitis, make treatment
	and resource allocation decisions, and for quality assurance. Artificial
	neural networks have been used to predict LOS in other conditions
	but not acute pancreatitis. The hypothesis of this study was that
	a neural network could predict LOS in patients with acute pancreatitis.
	The medical records of 195 patients admitted with acute pancreatitis
	were reviewed. A backpropagation neural network was developed to
	predict LOS >7 days. The network was trained on 156 randomly selected
	cases and tested on the remaining 39 cases. The neural network had
	the highest sensitivity (75%) for predicting LOS >7 days. Ranson
	criteria had the highest specificity (94%) for making this prediction.
	All methods incorrectly predicted LOS in two patients with severe
	acute pancreatitis who died early in their hospital course. An artificial
	neural network can predict LOS >7 days. The network and traditional
	prognostic indices were least accurate for predicting LOS in patients
	with severe acute pancreatitis who died early in their hospital course.
	The neural network has the advantage of making this prediction using

  abstract = {Introduction: Since their inception, the Injury Severity Score (ISS)
	and the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) have been suggested
	as measures of the quality of trauma care. In concept, they are designed
	to accurately assess injury severity and predict expected outcomes.
	ICISS, an injury severity methodology based on International Classification
	of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes, has been demonstrated to be superior
	to ISS and TRISS. The purpose of the present study was to compare
	the ability of TRISS to ICISS as predictors of survival and other
	outcomes of injury (hospital length of stay and hospital charges).
	It was our hypothesis that ICISS would outperform ISS and TRISS in
	each of these outcome predictions. Methods: "Training" data for creation
	of ICISS predictions were obtained from a state hospital discharge
	data base. "Test" data were obtained from a state trauma registry.
	ISS, TRISS, and ICISS were compared as predictors of patient survival.
	They were also compared as indicators of resource utilization by
	assessing their ability to predict patient hospital length of stay
	and hospital charges. Finally, a neural network was trained on the
	ICISS values and applied to the test data set in an effort to further
	improve predictive power. The techniques were compared by comparing
	each patient's outcome as predicted by the model to the actual outcome.
	Results: Seven thousand seven hundred five patients had complete
	data available for analysis. The ICISS was far more likely than ISS
	or TRISS to accurately predict every measure of outcome of injured
	patients tested, and the neural network further improved predictive
	power. Conclusion: In addition to predicting mortality, quality tools
	that can accurately predict resource utilization are necessary for
	effective trauma center quality-improvement programs. ICISS-derived
	predictions of survival, hospital charges, and hospital length of
	stay consistently outperformed those of ISS and TRISS. The neural
	network-augmented ICISS was even better. This and previous studies
	demonstrate that TRISS is a limited technique in predicting survival
	resource utilization. Because of the limitations of TRISS, it should
	be superseded by ICISS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND
	
	In recent years, considerable attention has been given to the development
	of sophisticated techniques for exploring data sets. One such class
	of techniques is artificial neural networks (ANNs). Artificial neural
	networks have many attractive theoretic properties, specifically,
	the ability to detect non predefined relations such as nonlinear
	effects and/or interactions. These theoretic advantages come at the
	cost of reduced interpretability of the model output. Many authors
	have analyzed the same data set, based on these factors, with both
	standard statistical methods (such as logistic or Cox regression)
	and ANN.
	
	
	METHODS
	
	The goal of this work is to review the literature comparing the performance
	of ANN with standard statistical techniques when applied to medium
	to large data sets (sample size > 200 patients). A thorough literature
	search was performed, with specific criteria for a published comparison
	to be included in this review.
	
	
	RESULTS
	
	In the 28 studies included in this review, ANN outperformed regression
	in 10 cases (36%), was outperformed by regression in 4 cases (14%),
	and the 2 methods had similar performance in the remaining 14 cases
	(50%). However, in the 8 largest studies (sample size > 5000), regression
	and ANN tied in 7 cases, with regression winning in the remaining
	case. In addition, there is some suggestion of publication bias.
	
	
	CONCLUSIONS
	
	Neither method achieves the desired performance. Both methods should
	continue to be used and explored in a complementary manner. However,
	based on the available data, ANN should not replace standard statistical
	approaches as the method of choice for the classification of medical
	data. Cancer 2001;91:1636–42. © 2001 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {Many confidence intervals calculated in practice are potentially not
	exact, either because the requirements for the interval estimator
	to be exact are known to be violated, or because the (exact) distribution
	of the data is unknown. If a confidence interval is approximate,
	the crucial question is how well its true coverage probability approximates
	its intended coverage probability. In this paper we propose to use
	the bootstrap to calculate an empirical estimate for the (true) coverage
	probability of a confidence interval. In the first instance, the
	empirical coverage can be used to assess whether a given type of
	confidence interval is adequate for the data at hand. More generally,
	when planning the statistical analysis of future trials based on
	existing data pools, the empirical coverage can be used to study
	the coverage properties of confidence intervals as a function of
	type of data, sample size, and analysis scale, and thus inform the
	statistical analysis plan for the future trial. In this sense, the
	paper proposes an alternative to the problematic pretest of the data
	for normality, followed by selection of the analysis method based
	on the results of the pretest. We apply the methodology to a data
	pool of bioequivalence studies, and in the selection of covariance
	patterns for repeated measures data.},

	and diagnostic classification in clinical medicine has become very
	popular. In particular, feed-forward neural networks have been used
	extensively, often accompanied by exaggerated statements of their
	potential. In this paper, the essentials of feed-forward neural networks
	and their statistical counterparts (that is, logistic regression
	models) are reviewed. We point out that the uncritical use of ANNs
	may lead to serious problems, such as the fitting of implausible
	functions to describe the probability of class membership and the
	underestimation of misclassification probabilities. In applications
	of ANNs to survival data, further difficulties arise. Finally, the
	results of a search in the medical literature from 1991 to 1995 on
	applications of ANNs in oncology and some important common mistakes
	are reported. It is concluded that there is no evidence so far that
	application of ANNs represents real progress in the field of diagnosis

	To provide an overview of the research steps that need to follow the

	Study Design and Setting
	
	Narrative review covering methodological and empirical prediction
	studies from primary and secondary care.
	
	
	Results
	
	In general, three types of validation of previously developed prediction
	rules can be distinguished: temporal, geographical, and domain validations.
	In case of poor validation, the validation data can be used to update
	or adjust the previously developed prediction rule to the new circumstances.
	These update methods differ in extensiveness, with the easiest method
	a change in model intercept to the outcome occurrence at hand. Prediction
	rules—with or without updating—showing good performance in (various)
	validation studies may subsequently be subjected to an impact study,
	to demonstrate whether they change physicians' decisions, improve
	clinically relevant process parameters, patient outcome, or reduce
	costs. Finally, whether a prediction rule is implemented successfully
	in clinical practice depends on several potential barriers to the
	use of the rule.
	
	
	Conclusion
	
	The development of a diagnostic or prognostic prediction rule is just
	a first step. We reviewed important aspects of the subsequent steps

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Clinical guidelines carry medical evidence to the point
	of practice. As evidence is not always available, many guidelines
	do not provide recommendations for all clinical situations encountered
	in practice. We propose an approach for identifying knowledge gaps
	in guidelines and for exploring physicians' therapeutic decisions
	with data mining techniques to fill these knowledge gaps. We demonstrate
	our method by an example in the domain of type 2 diabetes.METHODS:We
	analyzed the French national guidelines for the management of type
	2 diabetes to identify clinical conditions that are not covered or
	those for which the guidelines do not provide recommendations. We
	extracted patient records corresponding to each clinical condition
	from a database of type 2 diabetic patients treated at Avicenne University
	Hospital of Bobigny, France. We explored physicians' prescriptions
	for each of these profiles using C5.0 decision-tree learning algorithm.
	We developed decision-trees for different levels of detail of the
	therapeutic decision, namely the type of treatment, the pharmaco-therapeutic
	class, the international non proprietary name, and the dose of each
	medication. We compared the rules generated with those added to the
	guidelines in a newer version, to examine their similarity.RESULTS:We
	extracted 27 rules from the analysis of a database of 463 patient
	records. Eleven rules were about the choice of the type of treatment
	and thirteen rules about the choice of the pharmaco-therapeutic class
	of each drug. For the choice of the international non proprietary
	name and the dose, we could extract only a few rules because the
	number of patient records was too low for these factors. The extracted
	rules showed similarities with those added to the newer version of
	the guidelines.CONCLUSION:Our method showed its usefulness for completing
	guidelines recommendations with rules learnt automatically from physicians'
	prescriptions. It could be used during the development of guidelines
	as a complementary source from practice-based knowledge. It can also
	be used as an evaluation tool for comparing a physician's therapeutic
	decisions with those recommended by a given set of clinical guidelines.
	The example we described showed that physician practice was in some
	ways ahead of the guideline.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Effective planning of elective surgical procedures requiring
	postoperative intensive care is important in preventing cancellations
	and empty intensive care unit (ICU) beds. To improve planning, we
	constructed, validated and tested three models designed to predict
	length of stay (LOS) in the ICU in individual patients.METHODS:Retrospective
	data were collected from 518 consecutive patients who underwent oesophagectomy
	with reconstruction for carcinoma between January 1997 and April
	2005. Three multivariable linear regression models for LOS, namely
	preoperative, postoperative and intra-ICU, were constructed using
	these data. Internal validation was assessed using bootstrap sampling
	in order to obtain validated estimates of the explained variance
	(r2). To determine the potential gain of the best performing model
	in day-to-day clinical practice, prospective data from a second cohort
	of 65 consecutive patients undergoing oesophagectomy between May
	2005 and April 2006 were used in the model, and the predictive performance
	of the model was compared with prediction based on mean LOS.RESULTS:The
	intra-ICU model had an r2 of 45% after internal validation. Important
	prognostic variables for LOS included greater patient age, comorbidity,
	type of surgical approach, intraoperative respiratory minute volume
	and complications occurring within 72 hours in the ICU. The potential
	gain of the best model in day-to-day clinical practice was determined
	relative to mean LOS. Use of the model reduced the deficit number
	(underestimation) of ICU days by 65 and increased the excess number
	(overestimation) of ICU days by 23 for the cohort of 65 patients.
	A conservative analysis conducted in the second, prospective cohort
	of patients revealed that 7% more oesophagectomies could have been
	accommodated, and 15% of cancelled procedures could have been prevented.CONCLUSION:Patient
	characteristics can be used to create models that will help in predicting
	LOS in the ICU. This will result in more efficient use of ICU beds
	and fewer cancellations.},

	for measuring the consumption of hospital resources. Average length
	of stay, however, albeit easy to quantify and calculate, does not

	available nationwide data on stroke-related patients, aged 65 years
	and over, who were discharged from English hospitals over a 1-year
	period. This will be the basis for a running example illustrating
	the alternative methods of analysis and models of patients' length
	of stay. The methods include statistical methods: survival analysis,
	mixed exponential and phase-type distributions; and decision modelling
	techniques: compartmental and simulation models. The paper concludes
	by summarizing these various modelling techniques and by highlighting
	the similarity of the estimated parameters of patient flow as calculated
	by the phase-type distribution and compartmental modelling techniques.},

	been developed for, and validated in, younger trauma patients. <b>Aims:</b>
	We sought to determine the accuracy of the injury severity score
	(ISS) and the revised trauma score (RTS) in predicting mortality
	and hospital length of stay (LOS) in trauma patients over the age
	of 65 treated in our emergency department (ED). <b>Materials and
	Methods:</b> Using the Illinois Trauma Registry, we identified all
	patients 65 years and older treated in our level I trauma facility
	from January 2004 to November 2007. The primary outcome was death;
	the secondary outcome was overall hospital length of stay (LOS).
	We measured associations between scores and outcomes with binary
	logistic and linear regression. <b>Results:</b> A total of 347 patients,
	65 years of age and older were treated in our hospital during the
	study period. Median age was 76 years (IQR 69-82), with median ISS
	13 (IQR 8-17), and median RTS 7.8 (IQR 7.1-7.8). Overall mortality
	was 24%. A higher value for ISS showed a positive correlation with
	likelihood of death, which although statistically significant, was
	numerically small (OR=1.10, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.13, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
	An elevated RTS had an inverse correlation to likelihood of death
	that was also statistically significant (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.39 to
	0.58, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Total hospital LOS increased with increasing
	ISS, with statistical significance decreasing at the highest levels
	of ISS, but an increase in RTS not confirming the predicted decrease
	in total hospital LOS consistently across all ranges of RTS. <b>Conclusions:</b>
	The ISS and the RTS were better predictors of mortality than hypothesized,
	but had limited correlation with hospital LOS in elderly trauma patients.
	Although there may be some utility in these scores when applied to
	the elderly population, caution is warranted if attempting to predict
	the prognosis of patients.},

	Propensity scores for the analysis of observational data are typically
	estimated using logistic regression. Our objective in this review
	was to assess machine learning alternatives to logistic regression,
	which may accomplish the same goals but with fewer assumptions or
	greater accuracy.
	
	
	Study Design and Setting
	
	We identified alternative methods for propensity score estimation
	and/or classification from the public health, biostatistics, discrete
	mathematics, and computer science literature, and evaluated these
	algorithms for applicability to the problem of propensity score estimation,
	potential advantages over logistic regression, and ease of use.
	
	
	Results
	
	We identified four techniques as alternatives to logistic regression:
	neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees (classification
	and regression trees [CART]), and meta-classifiers (in particular,
	boosting).
	
	
	Conclusion
	
	Although the assumptions of logistic regression are well understood,
	those assumptions are frequently ignored. All four alternatives have
	advantages and disadvantages compared with logistic regression. Boosting
	(meta-classifiers) and, to a lesser extent, decision trees (particularly
	CART), appear to be most promising for use in the context of propensity
	score analysis, but extensive simulation studies are needed to establish
	their utility in practice.},

  year = {1992},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {241 - 259},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing
	the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked
	generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s)
	with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds
	by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example)
	the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of
	the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output
	is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers,
	stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version
	of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than
	cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual
	generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization
	is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of
	a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set
	and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization
	and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments.
	The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a
	set of separate generalizers for the \{NETtalk\} task of translating
	text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization
	improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other
	experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting
	cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this
	paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization
	problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to
	minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing
	some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches
	on other fields like chaos theory. },
